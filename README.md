Folder contains a mac address changer later added to Sonoma (under Security  Wifi Private or Rotatng Mac Address), wanted to incorporate this feature in older versions. Interface changer to down interfaces that are not required. Change hostname to allow you to change the name of the computer quickly. 
Check aliase in ZSHRC configs to add shortcuts to these scripts, or replace the configuration zshrc file with .zshrc.

Will add more as I require them for a type box. Sadly mac address does not change after restart, so added it into alias for fast usage -- this is a BSD problem ;) cheers.
